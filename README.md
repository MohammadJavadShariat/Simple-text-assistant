# Simple-text-assistant
Hello!
This program is a simple text assistant that can help you a lot in collecting and using data.
When the program starts, it will ask you to search for something.
If what you are searching for was already defined in the database, the assistant will show the text or texts that contain that word or fragment, but if what you are searching for is not stored in any of the information. If it doesn't exist, the device will ask you to add a text with the topic you searched for to the program so that the text assistant can be developed, and if not, search for something else.
If you enter the word development in the search field, you can also develop the program.
If you enter the word history in the search field, the history of your searches will be shown.
Hope you use and enjoy!
